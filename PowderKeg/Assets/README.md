Planned Ideas: 
* Another texture ontop of the map which is the lightmap, each particle has a light value that propogates to other pixels, whole map is black, light levels control opacity. 
* Have a timer decrease when more than 6 cells are steam together, when timer = 0, turn to water
* The more fire cells next to eachother, the brighter the fire
